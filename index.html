<pclass"Text"> Now for forge. As in the Pixelmon Mod you will need a different version of forge for different versions of Pixelmon. For example, the "3.5.1" Pixelmon needs the 1.7.10 forge. So you will need to go to the "Minecraft Forge" website. Here is the link "http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.7.10.html" Copy and paste, it should look like this</p>
